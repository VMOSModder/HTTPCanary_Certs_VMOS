# HTTPCanary Certs (VMOS Pro)

I make HTTPCanary cerificates for VMOS which allows you to capture encrypted request, ignore untrusted certificate issues

No root required... It can work even your virtual machine is not rooted!

VMOS doesn't support VPN, please install HTTPCanary app in your real system, it will capture all request done inside virtual machine
